# RpBuffBeg

*Ask nicely. Or not. It depends who you are.*

A WoW Forever and Classic Era roleplay addon. Target a friendly player whose class can buff you and RpBuffBeg asks them for it in `/say` (or a whisper, if you prefer), in your character's own voice. Pick a personality and every ask and every thank-you fits it:

> Um, Bob Smith? Sorry to bother you... could I maybe have Arcane Intellect? Only if it's no trouble. *(timid)*

> Bob Smith, what's your rate for a Blessing of Kings? I'm good for it. *(mercenary)*

## Personalities

Bold, Cheerful, Wise, Gruff, Roguish, Mystic, Scholarly and Timid (the same set as Campfire Tales Forever; a character's Campfire Tales personality is picked up on first login), plus Noble, Charming, Devout and Mercenary, or "A bit of everything". Each has 20 asks, 10 refreshes and 16 thank-yous, plus 4 asks for each class of your own (a timid warrior, a gruff mage, a charming warlock...), used 3 times in 10. 984 lines in all, times four with the accents below.

Pick it per character in Esc > Options > AddOns > RpBuffBeg (with a Preview button), by right-clicking the icon, or with `/buffbeg persona <name>`.

## Accents

Orcs, trolls and dwarves don't talk like everyone else, so every one of those lines also comes in an orc, troll and dwarf version. Same personality and same joke, said their way:

> Bob Smith, what be ya rate for some Blessing of Kings? Me good for it, mon. *(mercenary troll)*

> Um, Bob Smith? Sorry tae bother ye... could I maybe have Arcane Intellect? Only if it's nae trouble, lad. *(timid dwarf)*

> Bob Smith! You there. Power Word: Fortitude, on me. I put it to good use. Bloody use. *(bold orc)*

Your race picks the accent (orc, troll or dwarf; everyone else speaks plainly). Only that one set of lines is kept in memory; the others are dropped at login.

## What you ask for

| Their class | You ask for |
|---|---|
| Paladin | Blessing of Kings (level 20+), then Blessing of Might if you're a warrior or rogue, Blessing of Wisdom otherwise. Classic Era: Might/Wisdom first, since Kings is a talent there |
| Druid | Mark of the Wild |
| Priest | Power Word: Fortitude, then Divine Spirit (level 30+) if you use mana |
| Mage | Arcane Intellect, if you use mana |

You never ask for a buff you already have, unless it's about to drop (20 minutes left; 2 in Classic Era), and never for one your target is too low level to know. Group versions count as given.

## Features

- **Icon next to the target frame**, shown while your target has a buff for you. With [EzBlessings](https://github.com/lalibertemarc/EzBlessings) on a paladin, it sits just under the EzBlessings button instead, and follows it if you move it. Click to ask. A check mark means you have everything they can give; a gold border means a buff is fading and the click asks for a refresh. Right-click to change your personality.
- **Thank-you button** (the coin) beside it.
- **Say or whisper.** Lines go out in `/say` by default; switch to whispering them to your target on the options page or with `/buffbeg whisper`. The setting is shared by all your characters.
- **Clickable names.** Your target's name in your own line becomes a class-colored player link in your chat.
- **Key bindings** for both under Options > Keybindings > RpBuffBeg. They work with the interface hidden.
- **Steps aside for EzMinion.** On a warlock with EzMinion loaded, RpBuffBeg stays off (no icon, bindings or options), since EzMinion already orders your buffs. Other classes are unaffected.

Edit the lines in `Voices.lua` (`{name}`, `{buff}`, and `{me}`/`{my}`, which become "us"/"our" in a group), their accented versions in `VoicesOrc.lua`, `VoicesTroll.lua` and `VoicesDwarf.lua` (dwarves also get `{lad}`: "lad" or "lass"), and the buffs in `Data.lua`.
